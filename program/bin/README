How to run the scripts
================
* To see the `help` of R scripts run them like:
  `Rscript ~/path_to_script/script.R -h`
* To see the help of Perl scripts, make the files executable with 
  `chmod +x script.pl` and run them like: 
  `~/path_to_script/script.pl`


Dependencies
================
* Check each script code for dependencies and further documentation.
* To install R script dependencies use `install.package()`, 
  or `install.packages("BiocManager")` and `BiocManager::install()` 
  The full list of R packages is: 
  `"optparse", "vioplot", "GSA", "parallel", "data.table", "GSVA", "qvalue", "precrec", "ROCR", "Seurat", "dplyr", "Rserve", "fisher.test", "p.adjust", "SummarizedExperiment", "MetaNeighbor"`
* To install Perl script dependencies download `perl_modules` directory from this repository 
  and add it to your `PERL5LIB` environment variable.
  Other Perl modules required are: `Date::Calc` which can be installed from CPAN
* Note modifications to the R library(MetaNeighbor) source code were made
  See: `bin/r_programs/obtains_METANEIGHBOR_for_MatrixColumns.R` for details
* The following Java scripts are needed:
  CIBERSORT.jar can be obtained from https://cibersort.stanford.edu/download.php 
  gsea-3.0.jar  can be obtained from http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/downloads.jsp
